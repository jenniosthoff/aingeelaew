                            <p> I picked it up and there's nothing installed on survivor's data. Dingus dangit. Hello, Subnautica noob here, I just got a mission to head out to Lifepod 3, when i got there and clicked the PDA file that was inside the lifepod to download the data, but i never got any information, and the PDA file disappeared from the ground, will this effect my gameplay/story not having this information from the lifepod? I tried to restart the game and do it again but had the same outcome 3 times so i guess i wont get it, so is it crucial to the story So, i am intoducing my friend to interpol with only 5 songs. Which songs should

Group Stage A-H Results (https://www.reddit.com/r/Interpol/comments/933r7c/interpol_song_tournament_2018_group_stage_first/) Group Stages I-P Results (https://www.reddit.com/r/Interpol/comments/94z2op/interpol_song_tournament_group_stage_second_half/) So we've gone down from 64 songs to 32, and for the straight 1v1s there is a seeding system. For a spot in the final 16 here we see first placed songs from groups A-H, facing off against. List your top ten favorite songs by the artist in ranked order, with #1 being your absolute favorite. - Listing a song as your #1 pick will give it 10 points, your #2 pick receives 9 points, #3 receives 8 points, etc. - The ten songs with the most overall points will be our top ten for this week. - Upvoting or downvoting someone else's list won't make a difference. - You're encouraged to explore the artist's discography and think about it before you decide on your top ten. The deadline is Sunda. So. I'm working on something, i don't want to tell exacly what it is, but yeah. Here's what problem do i have. If you open yours pda https://gyazo.com/eb24f06c9912fc824b450236a965b01a And then type unbind 1,2,3 or 4 doesn't matter. https://i.gyazo.com/85b9b8027e33f7f504de3623723f1c63.png And. now you are still be able to build by pressing 1 https://i.gyazo.com/5d48d16015ce9b8048c43789bcd8ff54.jpg and now the main question: Is this possible to open pda and make your own binds to 1,2,3. 
I have been messing around with it a while and havent got my head around it. I did manage to use editPDAs programme and use it but i couldnt find the pda later on. So what am i missing. I know that a PDA with a local database is the fastest scanning method. What I don't understand is why can't a smart phone do what a PDA can in terms of processing speed. I had read that ATampT was starting to be aware of your usage of this app. Does it still work? Can ATampT do anything about it? I'd like to buy it but want to be sure first. Sorry if this is a little long but I have been trying to unbrick my phone for 24 hours to no avail. So here's the rundown. I have a Sprint Note 2 (SPH-L900). I heard that Sprint was releasing 4.3 out in OTA but after several days of waiting, I got impatient. I went onto the XDA forum and discovered that some users had uploaded the OTA update Excited, I downloaded but in my inexperience I failed to realize that that file was meant A couple of observations: 1. We're at the four seasons hotel. This probably has some significance, because otherwise why name the place at all (as Rae, I believe, pointed out)? Unless it's just a sadistic glimpse of hope for our contestants. 2. On the PDA 3/79 2079 was clearly meant to be read as a date format (with the 7s as ones). The obvious reason is to mislead us, the audience. But is there an in game reason? What if it is a date? A date in a different calendar system based around
