                            <p> This post got removed for being feedback on the Revelry. It is not. This is a topic about the game in general, really more to do with comp and FOMO. I have no suggestions on how to improve the Revelry or what I liked or didn't like about it. This is addressing a large issue with the game since launch, which has been causing a lot of ruckus in the community. \_\_ For those who don't know, "FOMO" means "Fear Of Missing Out." Destiny 2, far more than Destiny 1, has a huge empha. Maddie arrived at our door eight years ago with a shiny red bow around her throat and an instruction manual at the bottom of the box. Feed it six times a day. Keep it clean. No refunds. The box had no return address. The mailmen refused to take it back. I tried to throw it into the garbage, into the fireplace, into the lake behind the middle school. It always turned up again anyway, on the doorstep in the middle of the night, covered in grime or soot or water as if someone I first met the Unicorn while I was being hunted. I plunged my bike down into a rocky drainage ditch, slammed on the brakes, and threw myself behind a large bush. I heard the remorseless grumble of the black pickup truck slowly inch by. They were looking for me, Boy Gosset and his brother Clint. Ever since they told me they were going to kick my ass after class, I knew they'd be coming for me. As soon as the end of day bell rang, I made a beeline for my bike and took off like a rocket. Someone told me to post this here. I don't really come to this sub once, being in my late 20s I find my outlook on drugs is a lot different than most people here. I'm as staunchly pro drug as before after seeing how much misery everything but soft drugs have brought me, my family, my friends, everyone I've ever been locked up with. I'm sure someone will ask about my sobriety, I'm 7 weeks off fent/dope down to 16 grams of kratom a day from 40g. I'm facing prison time for a violation coming. Hey everyone! Wow, three years. I didn't even notice it was almost my Cake Day until fairly late last night. In truth, I've had this account for three years but didn't really use it for much up until a little over a month ago when I started talking to you fine folk. I'm so thankful for the chance to be a part of this community and to read everyone's experiences. It's really dragged me out of a dark place to know I'm not alone. You've all been kind to me and I can't thank you everyone enough. It's interesting, and a bit of work to try and imagine everything with psionics rather than science. Whether I'm doing a good job at it or not is something that sits in the back of my head of course. It's going to get even more fun when I have to start doing the science part of the science vs psionics theme. With the exception of three linked plot-science elements, Humanity is otherwise relegated to hard science in this story. It does bother me when I read fantasy stories just chock 
My name is Adam and, yeah, like the title says I was lately the pianist for the Grand Luciferian Temple of Gehenna located just outside of Dublin, Texas. Haven’t heard of it? Doesn’t surprise me. And before you ask, no, I wasn’t a Temple member or even a believer in any of that Satanic black magic mumbo-jumbo crap. Hell, I was raised Methodist. It was just another job as far as I was concerned; one I took out of necessity more than anything else. At twenty-two years old, fresh Buy my stuff so I can buy stuff! I've got plenty of trades completed on /r/retrogameswap and /r/gameswap - very old but hopefully reassuring /r/mushroomkingdom trade thread here (https://www.reddit.com/r/mushroomkingdom/comments/1nfrsd/btgreenone_successful_trades/) and you can of course check my post history for more recent stuff as well as the rest of my (unpriced) list. Mostly interested in PayPal but will consider trades as well. Bundle stuff for lower prices - I'll throw in one thing label. Hi! It's my first time posting on this subreddit, and I wanted to contribute my meager writings to this great collection of stories. It's not the best, but I tried my best. Let me know if I made any errors and ill try to fix them. I love to take constructive criticism (At least I think I do) so feel free to help me out in the comments. And enjoy! Dawn of the WAY Tam’ithr Valertus Sanert Eras sat down in the chair, his legs aching from hours of standing still during the so-called “Celebration. Hello, fellow wastelanders, I decided to put my TS explosive / heavy weapons collection to a better use and run some tests on Mirelurk Queen. Why? Well she's mean, big, quite resistant, spawns reliably and those guns just don't like sitting in the stash. And maybe some of you want to know how they actually behave, before shelling out hard-earned caps or trading legendaries. As for the test setup: I run full Heavy Gunner/Demo build with Bloody Mess (https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v. She was born yesterday. Her parents are near in our family tree. These are not primitives. Both husband and wife have hard-earned Ph.D.'s, a handsome, talented, busy couple. She lived forty minutes. They knew that it would be this way. Months ago, the ultrasound revealed an absence of amniotic fluid, the result of an absence of kidneys. Ultrasounds can be off sometimes, so they kept track of it. No, it's not getting better. She has little to no chance. The parents grieved. They follow. My grandfather was a high school English teacher in New Jersey during the 1950s and 60s. He passed away recently. During the arduous process of going through his belongings, my brother found an old bank box, filled with thousands upon thousands of student submissions strewn throughout the middle of the twentieth century. He kept his favorite ones. Most of them are pretty tame - tests on the poignancy of Shakespeare, the dark quality of Poe, the mystique behind Lovecraft; you get the idea. 
Since the weather in my neighborhood was getting nicer, I figured "Instead of playing video games INSIDE, I'm going to play video games OUTSIDE." This was a big mistake. I go out to my backyard, bringing a blanket to sit on, some chips, and a bottle of water. Since my neighbors were having a little "easter party" I made sure my volume was turned down so I don't disturb them. (And to lower my chances of having to deal with a little brat asking if he can play. This does not work). After about. Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6278bi/my_journey_and_tips_29_gpa_at_a_noname_liberal/ (^ covers the basics which I won't really repeat here, like my timeline out of school or how I received interviews in the first place) My last post here had an amazing response from all of you and now that it's coming up on 2 years—and with my recently going through another interview cycle—it seems like it's a good time for an update. I stand by my prior advice Gear album: https://imgur.com/a/2fTeZgo I've been meaning to put one of these together forever, so here goes! I'll just start by saying up front that this is not a minimalist pack. I'd call myself a pretty seasoned ultralight backpacker, but currently my priorities are a little different. I've been on the road since September with my girlfriend, working remotely for a software agency back in the US. I spent a lot of time on this sub agonizing about bags and gear before leaving 
Even though I live in WOC and small bags, I realized I do need more totes and bags without all the chain hardware for the straps, and more bags without the extra step of the front flap AND hardware to open the bag. It's not really that easy to run around doing errands with all the chains to grab, or the hardware at the front to open, then the front flap etc., so wanted to fill out my "errand-running" tote collection - bags that you can grab and go, and stuff groceries in and out of, without. Hey guys, I wrote a lengthy review of the game, making an in-depth analysis of its narrative - as I try to do with all the games that I review. I've seen a lot of people complaining about Octopath's story, and while I can see where their complaints come from, I found the game's narrative excellent in many ways. Of course, there are some minor spoilers \- I describe some scenes from Primrose's chapter one and one scene from her second chapter, I use direct quotes and discuss about each chara. Things dragons like 10 - High places 9 - Storms 8 - Being feared and/or worshipped 7 - A good old fashioned rampage of death and destruction 6 - Fighting 5 - Compliments 4 - Treasure 3 - Treasure 2 - Treasure 1 - Treasure The latest challengers had arrived. I licked my chops in anticipation, feeling liquid fire roll over my teeth. Shimmering air surrounded my head, turning the inner chamber into a sauna. The party paused at my door, discussing their next move. I never considered myself a Chanel girl. I mean, it's pretty but it always looked a little fussy to me. The smart tweed jackets, the precious quilting, the plethora of pearls.it all read a bit "rich old lady who hates her grandkids" when I considered myself more of a "formerly poor but now borderline bougie gothy old lady who tries to attract as many kids as possible to her house on Halloween." But then I joined repladies and saw how wonderfully you all style your Chanel!! While I still. Previous (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ba5gde/smolpup_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) First (https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b3x0sq/smolpup_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) DISCLAIMER: I do not claim to own any of the ideas or worlds described in the story. The ‘They are Smol’ universe is the intellectual property of u/TinyPrancingHorse. Nothing in the story is canon to his universe, and I’d suggest you visit his writings if you love wholesome stories. Adrenaline Junkies , though this might be more of a subversive entry. A few of the local townsfolk gathered to see Vance disembark from the shuttle. Most of the villagers were afraid of Vance, but more still were terrified of his vaunted traveling companion. The long gang plank lowered from under the nose of the shuttle, and among the pallet skiffs and locals disembarking, strode Vance. Most of the local Remin had seen a Human before, on Holo if not actually in the flesh. What had drawn. Sadly this is not the funniest or the nastiest but this is the most embarrassing confession. I am dealing with this today. I injured myself masturbating. I rarely use toys but i love them. I had a huge collection in my early 20's but they all melted from being left in a car when i was 22. I just never purchased anything else but a small butt plug I've had for about 6 years that i use as a dildo because of its small size and it has a small, perfect curve that hits the right spots.
